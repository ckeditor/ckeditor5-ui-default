## Vertical scrolling

1. When the page is scrolled vertically, the toolbar should
	1. stick to the top of the viewport first,
	1. then disappear beyond the upper edge of the viewport as it touches the red area
	1. but never cover the red area or go beyond the upper edge of editor mock–up.

## Horizontal scrolling

1. The toolbar should always fit horizontally within the editor mock–up, regardless of the position of the h– and v–scrolls of the web page.

## On–load positioning

1. Scroll the web page vertically and horizontally, so the toolbar is sticky.
1. Reload the web page.
1. The toolbar should get sticky as the page reloads, if the position of scrollbars and the geometry of the viewport creates such a need.
